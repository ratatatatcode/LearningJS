Here are some of methods I learned.
arr.push(num); // add num from the end
arr.unshift(num); // add num from the beginning

arr.pop(); // remove the last element
arr.shift(); // remove first element

arr.splice(0, 2);
// Delete from index 0 to index 2

arr.splice(0, 2, third and so on..., 3, 4, 5);
// Delete from index 0 to index 2 and the 3,4,5 will replace the previous value of index 0-2

newArr = arr.splice(0, 2)
// You can use this to copy all the recently removed elements from the array

arr.indexOf('check');
// You can use this to check if the element 'check' still exist in the array
// It there is no element 'check' from the array, it will give you a value -1
